Many factors have been associated with enhanced tumor aggressiveness, metastases, and resistance to systemic/targeted therapies. Some of these factors include tumoral genetic/epigenetic alterations and rearrangement of tumor microenvironment (TME) components through dynamic and mutual cross-talk. Nitric oxide (NO) within the TME has gained interest for its influence on tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Various studies have revealed that NO can both promote and inhibit tumor progression and metastasis. However, NO's protumoral and antitumoral effects are primarily dependent on cellular sensitivity to NO, activity and localization of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), and concentration/duration of NO exposure. Therefore, it is warranted to discuss the nuanced influence NO plays on cancer metastasis and response to therapy. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the roles of NO in tumor progression and cancer metastasis. We also discuss the potential of targeting NOS isoforms to augment the efficacy of systemic and targeted therapies for cancer treatment.\",\n",

These include modulating vascular function (vascular permeability, vasodilation, angiogenesis), neural system development, neurotransmission, heme signaling, smooth muscle relaxation, immune responses, platelet, and cytotoxic functions. NOSs are a family of enzymes that produce NO by converting L-arginine to L-citrulline and concomitantly produce NO. There are three NOS isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS/NOS1), endothelial NOS (eNOS/NOS3), and inducible NOS (iNOS/NOS2; ref.). These enzymes are numbered in the order the cDNAs were initially cloned. nNOS is constitutively expressed in neuronal cells and is crucial for neural signaling, whereas eNOS was first described in endothelial cells where it regulates vascular tone and angiogenesis. In a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner, eNOS/nNOS produce nanomolar concentrations of NO within seconds to minutes. iNOS differs from the eNOS/nNOS isoforms as cells typically do not express iNOS. Its expression is induced in response to proinflammatory molecules [interferon gamma (IFN\\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-1\\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\\u03b1), prostaglandins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)] and/or hypoxia, and iNOS generates micromolar concentrations with cellular effects that last for hours. Some of these proinflammatory NOS2 stimulants not only enhance the production of NO but also upregulate the production of key aggressive cancer markers, such as S100 calcium-binding protein, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1, IL6, and IL8.\",\n",

NO signaling is a function of NO concentration, and varied concentrations drive distinct signaling pathways. Within the TME, the influence of NO on protumor and antitumor functions is divided into three categories, depending on NO flux concentration: (i) cGMP-dependent signaling (<100 nmol/L NO), (ii) pro-oncogenic nitrosative signaling (50\\u2013300 nmol/L NO), and (iii) nitrosative stress signaling (500\\u20132,000 nmol/L NO; Fig. 1; refs.). This paradoxical role of NO within the TME is further complicated by NO's influence on innate and adaptive immune responses. NO can be derived from multiple cellular sources including tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages (predominately murine origin), fibroblasts, antigen-presenting cells, natural killer (NK) cells, etc.. In humans, iNOS was first cloned from epithelial cells (hepatocytes); therefore, it is not surprising that there is a role for iNOS in many cancers of epithelial origin. The cellular type, location, and number of cells expressing iNOS are critical determinants of enhanced tumorigenesis (e.g., colon carcinoma cells expressing iNOS are associated with enhanced tumor progression, whereas TME-associated leukocytes expressing iNOS are associated with reduced tumor progression; ref.). Altered S-nitrosation is crucial for promoting malignant phenotypes, including metastasis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, antiapoptotic signaling, genomic instability, and metabolic reprogramming (Fig. 2; refs.). In this review, we discuss how intermediate concentrations of NO influence key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways/proteins associated with cancer metastasis and therapy resistance.\",\n",

The small GTPase Ras, one of the earliest described S-nitrosation targets, is nitrosylated at Cys118, resulting in enhanced guanine nucleotide exchange and stimulation of downstream pathways such as MAPK signaling.

Using the MDA-MB-468 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, they showed that NO-induced S-nitrosation of wild-type Ras led to phosphorylation and activation of Ets via the Ras/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Knockdown of Ets inhibited NO-dependent expression of basal-like breast cancer markers (P-cadherin, S100A8, IL8, and \\u03b1\\u03b2-crystallin), attenuated NO-mediated matrix metalloprotease activity, and cancer cell invasion.

Specifically, TIMP1 protein nitration and its protein\\u2013protein interaction with CD63 were observed in breast cancer cells that underwent NO-induced Akt activation. These findings suggest that breast tumors with elevated iNOS and TIMP1 expression exert their oncogenic function by Akt activation, leading to an aggressive phenotype.

Furthermore, in melanoma cell models, iNOS-derived NO can S-nitrosylate phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein, thereby attenuating PTEN phosphatase activity and stimulating PI3K/Akt signaling. Furthermore, iNOS expression is associated with worse overall survival in melanoma patients with intact PTEN expression in tumors, likely via iNOS-mediated stimulation of PI3K signaling.

Pharmacologic and genomic inhibition of iNOS significantly reduced colon CSCs tumorigenic capacity in vitro and in vivo, likely due to reduced expression of genes involved in tumor initiation and CSC maintenance (CD133, \\u03b2-catenin, Bmi-1, and NF-\\u03baB p65). NOS2 knockdown in colon CSCs led to enhanced biosynthesis of alkaline phosphatase after exposure to sodium butyrate, revealing that NOS expression modulates cellular differentiation. Using a superficial colon tumor model, NOS2 knockdown blocked the growth of colon CSC-derived xenografts, suggesting that iNOS may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment and management of colon cancer.\",\n",

These mesenchymal-like cells have enhanced invasiveness, migratory capacity, resistance to apoptosis, stem-like features and produce extracellular matrix components. NO's influence on pro-and antimigratory properties of tumor cells mediated by EMT depends on NO concentration. Typically, elevated NO concentrations (500\\u20132,000 nmol/L) repress EMT transcriptional programming, whereas intermediate-to-low NO concentrations (<500 nmol/L) are associated with cancer progression and invasiveness via enhanced EMT function. A high flux of NO prevents NF-\\u03baB activity by either S-nitrosation of the p50 subunit of NF-\\u03baB, reducing DNA-binding activity, or by inhibition of phosphorylation and dissociation of I\\u03baB\\u03b1. Snail, a key EMT transcription factor, is transcriptionally induced by NF-\\u03baB but inhibited by E-cadherin and metastasis-suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP; ref.). In human metastatic prostate cancer cell lines treated with supraphysiological concentrations of NO via NO donor DETA NONOate, there was a reduction in Snail expression, upregulation of E-cadherin and RKIP, and a reversal of mesenchymal phenotype and cell invasive properties. In an alveolar epithelial cell model that recapitulates features of human interstitial lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia), exogenous NO reduces EMT (reduced collagen I and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression). In contrast, treatment with L-NAME (pan-NOS inhibitor) causes a spontaneous increase in EMT.\",\n",

In a study using murine models of claudin-low and basal-like breast cancer, dietary energy balance [calorie-restriction or diet-induced obesity (DIO)] differentially modulated EMT and tumor progression. DIO promoted tumor progression and EMT, as evidenced by enhanced expression of N-cadherin, fibronectin, and decreased expression of E-cadherin in mammary tumors. In both claudin-low and basal-like tumor models, DIO promoted the expression of EMT and tumor-initiating cell (TIC) genes, such as TGF\\u03b2, Snail, FOXC2, and Oct4, which are modulated by obesity-related growth factors. In murine syngeneic models of TNBC, high-fat-diet treatment is associated with enhanced tumoral hypoxia, neutrophil infiltration, decreased vascularity, EMT programming, and retention of tumor-initiating CSCs relative to mice treated with regular diet. These findings suggest that obesity-associated factors (that have yet to be identified) may be critically involved in promoting an aggressive TNBC phenotype in patients with obesity. Furthermore, fatty tissue inflammation associated with obesity results in the production of critical inflammatory modulators, such as COX2, prostaglandins (PG), and NO. These eicosanoids and inflammatory modulators are crucial for the development and growth of breast cancers, either via the production of aromatase for estrogen-dependent breast cancers or directly promoting an aggressive phenotype in estrogen-independent breast cancers [via NO and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production; refs. ].\",\n",

About one-third of the US population is obese, and an additional one-third is overweight, requiring $190 billion in healthcare expenditures. The link between obesity and cancer, particularly its influence on metastasis, has not been delineated. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), excess body fat was linked to 13 cancers, such as postmenopausal breast cancer. The current approach of utilizing BMI as a surrogate marker in relation to cancer risk may not completely capture the complexities associated with adipose TME and tumorigenesis. Instead, a better marker would be evaluating the quality of adipose tissue, particularly in response to body-weight gain or metabolic obesity. In metabolic obesity, adipocytes typically undergo hypertrophy/hyperplasia, increasing the demand for vascular supply. As the demand decreases, regions of fatty tissue become hypoxic, resulting in adipocyte stress/death and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) into the environment. DAMPs (such as free fatty acids, lipid metabolites, thioredoxin-interacting protein, s100 proteins, nucleic acids, cholesterol, and ATP) trigger an innate immune response (composed of dendritic cells, macrophages, and granulocytes), the formation of crown-like structures, and proinflammatory responses. These proinflammatory responses include the accumulation of proinflammatory molecules (TNF\\u03b1, IFN\\u03b3, IL6, IL1\\u03b2, and iNOS) and proinflammatory cells (granulocytes, B cells, and CD8+ T cells), resulting in a chronic inflammatory response. This obesity-associated chronic proinflammatory response enhances vascular inflammation and permeability, leading to cancer cell dissemination.\",\n",

This is likely due to an impairment in vascular integrity through loss of endothelial adhesions through obesity-induced lung neutrophils, resulting in cancer cell extravasation to the lung. McDowell and colleagues found that relative to neutrophils from lean mice, neutrophils from obese mice expressed genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as NOS2, and had low expression of genes essential for antioxidant activity as CAT. Specifically, neutrophil-produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, such as NO, increased the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), which weakened vascular integrity. Deleting NOS2 in diet-induced obese mice with breast cancer leads to an increase in JAM1+ vessels, reduced vascular permeability, and breast cancer extravasation. These findings suggest that obesity is associated with oxidative stress markers, such as NOS2 and NETosis, during lung metastases. Therefore, targeting these pathways with lifestyle modifications and NOS inhibitors may decrease metastatic risk in patients with obesity.\",\n",

One example is that the biphasic role of NO complicates the regimen of choice for NO-based therapies, making this therapeutic strategy difficult in clinical settings. Another challenge is developing a standardized approach to decide what patients would benefit the most if NOS inhibitors were incorporated into their treatment arsenal and how would this decision be made. A set of robust, evidence-based biomarkers, such as iNOS IHC staining of tumor biopsy samples or tumor sequencing to detect RPL39 A14V/MLF2 R158W oncogenic mutations, might be needed to determine whether NOS inhibition should be considered. In human ER\\u2212 breast tumors, high iNOS expression strongly correlates with increased TP53 mutation frequency. This may be mediated by NO inactivating p53 function, either via loss of DNA-binding activity or selecting for mutant TP53. Therefore, along with iNOS IHC staining, evaluating TP53 mutation status may also be worthwhile as a combined biomarker to determine whether a patient should receive a NOS inhibitor.\",\n",

These can include hypertension and decreased cardiac output due to their inadvertent inhibition of the eNOS isoform. Cautionary tales from the negative results of the phase III TRIUMPH trial, in which L-NMMA was tested in patients with cardiogenic shock postmyocardial infarction, may have steered clinical trialists from using NOS inhibitors in other clinical settings. However, the early cessation of the TRIUMPH trial was because L-NMMA did not reduce overall mortality; however, L-NMMA was well tolerated with a safe toxicity profile. Although there are doubts about using nonselective NOS inhibitors for cardiogenic shock, repurposing its use in anticancer therapies should be considered. In a phase II clinical trial testing L-NMMA combined with taxane-based chemotherapy for chemorefractory and metastatic TNBC, no grade \\u22653 toxicity was attributed to L-NMMA. The adverse events possibly attributed to L-NMMA were reported for 4/35 patients, which were pulmonary symptoms [grade 1 cough (n = 2), grade 1 dyspnea (n = 1), and grade 2 dyspnea (n = 2)]. L-NMMA-induced hypertension can be well managed with antihypertensive medications, such as amlodipine. Further progress on appropriately utilizing NOS inhibitors in the clinical setting of oncology is still needed and should be seriously considered.\",\n",

      "Utilizing targeted therapies capable of reducing cancer metastasis, targeting chemoresistant and self-renewing cancer stem cells, and augmenting the efficacy of systemic chemo/radiotherapies is vital to minimize cancer-associated mortality. Targeting nitric oxide synthase (NOS), a protein within the tumor microenvironment, has gained interest as a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce metastatic capacity and augment the efficacy of chemo/radiotherapies in various solid malignancies. Our review highlights the influence of nitric oxide (NO) in tumor progression and cancer metastasis, as well as promising preclinical studies that evaluated NOS inhibitors as anticancer therapies. Lastly, we highlight the prospects and outstanding challenges of using NOS inhibitors in the clinical setting.\n",

      "Cancer metastasis and therapy resistance are the fundamental causes of mortality from solid tumors. Many factors have been associated with enhanced tumor aggressiveness, metastases, and resistance to systemic/targeted therapies. Some of these factors include tumoral genetic/epigenetic alterations and rearrangement of tumor microenvironment (TME) components through dynamic and mutual cross-talk. Nitric oxide (NO) within the TME has gained interest for its influence on tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Various studies have revealed that NO can both promote and inhibit tumor progression and metastasis. However, NO's protumoral and antitumoral effects are primarily dependent on cellular sensitivity to NO, activity and localization of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), and concentration/duration of NO exposure. Therefore, it is warranted to discuss the nuanced influence NO plays on cancer metastasis and response to therapy. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the roles of NO in tumor progression and cancer metastasis. We also discuss the potential of targeting NOS isoforms to augment the efficacy of systemic and targeted therapies for cancer treatment.\n",

      "NO is a simple, multifunctional, and gaseous-free radical that regulates numerous biological functions. These include modulating vascular function (vascular permeability, vasodilation, angiogenesis), neural system development, neurotransmission, heme signaling, smooth muscle relaxation, immune responses, platelet, and cytotoxic functions. NOSs are a family of enzymes that produce NO by converting L-arginine to L-citrulline and concomitantly produce NO. There are three NOS isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS/NOS1), endothelial NOS (eNOS/NOS3), and inducible NOS (iNOS/NOS2; ref.). These enzymes are numbered in the order the cDNAs were initially cloned. nNOS is constitutively expressed in neuronal cells and is crucial for neural signaling, whereas eNOS was first described in endothelial cells where it regulates vascular tone and angiogenesis. In a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner, eNOS/nNOS produce nanomolar concentrations of NO within seconds to minutes. iNOS differs from the eNOS/nNOS isoforms as cells typically do not express iNOS. Its expression is induced in response to proinflammatory molecules [interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), prostaglandins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)] and/or hypoxia, and iNOS generates micromolar concentrations with cellular effects that last for hours. Some of these proinflammatory NOS2 stimulants not only enhance the production of NO but also upregulate the production of key aggressive cancer markers, such as S100 calcium-binding protein, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1, IL6, and IL8.\n",

      "NO signaling is typically defined as either cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent or cGMP-independent. iNOS-derived NO is capable of producing cGMP and inducing posttranslational modifications (PTM) of proteins with thiol and amine groups. NO signaling is a function of NO concentration, and varied concentrations drive distinct signaling pathways. Within the TME, the influence of NO on protumor and antitumor functions is divided into three categories, depending on NO flux concentration: (i) cGMP-dependent signaling (<100 nmol/L NO), (ii) pro-oncogenic nitrosative signaling (50–300 nmol/L NO), and (iii) nitrosative stress signaling (500–2,000 nmol/L NO; Fig. 1; refs.). This paradoxical role of NO within the TME is further complicated by NO's influence on innate and adaptive immune responses. NO can be derived from multiple cellular sources including tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages (predominately murine origin), fibroblasts, antigen-presenting cells, natural killer (NK) cells, etc.. In humans, iNOS was first cloned from epithelial cells (hepatocytes); therefore, it is not surprising that there is a role for iNOS in many cancers of epithelial origin. The cellular type, location, and number of cells expressing iNOS are critical determinants of enhanced tumorigenesis (e.g., colon carcinoma cells expressing iNOS are associated with enhanced tumor progression, whereas TME-associated leukocytes expressing iNOS are associated with reduced tumor progression; ref.). Altered S-nitrosation is crucial for promoting malignant phenotypes, including metastasis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, antiapoptotic signaling, genomic instability, and metabolic reprogramming (Fig. 2; refs.). In this review, we discuss how intermediate concentrations of NO influence key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways/proteins associated with cancer metastasis and therapy resistance.\n",

      "Increased production of NO and dysregulated S-nitrosation can influence tumor initiation and metastasis. S-nitrosation regulates the enzymatic/catalytic function of critical proteins, thereby influencing the function of signaling pathways such as MAPK, PI3K/Akt, β-catenin, and cytoskeletal processes. The small GTPase Ras, one of the earliest described S-nitrosation targets, is nitrosylated at Cys118, resulting in enhanced guanine nucleotide exchange and stimulation of downstream pathways such as MAPK signaling. Switzer and colleagues discovered that in NOS2-high estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast tumors, a subset of upregulated genes have binding sites for the Ets transcription factor. Using the MDA-MB-468 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, they showed that NO-induced S-nitrosation of wild-type Ras led to phosphorylation and activation of Ets via the Ras/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Knockdown of Ets inhibited NO-dependent expression of basal-like breast cancer markers (P-cadherin, S100A8, IL8, and αβ-crystallin), attenuated NO-mediated matrix metalloprotease activity, and cancer cell invasion. These findings suggest that NO/Ets-1 cross-talk via S-nitrosation may promote an aggressive phenotype and tumor metastasis in basal-like breast cancers.\n",

      "NO, at physiologically relevant concentrations, can activate tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src via S-nitrosation in TNBC cell lines. In these studies, TNBC cell lines were treated with NO donor DETANO to recapitulate NO concentration fluxes found within the TME. SNO formation in EGFR/Src mediated activation of downstream oncogenic signaling pathways (Akt, β-catenin, and c-Myc) and loss of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) tumor suppressor function. NO treatment via DETANO also reduced cell–cell adhesion and enhanced migratory capacity via the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Using an ER+ breast cancer model, Rahman and colleagues discovered that c-Src can be S-nitrosylated at cysteine 498 (Cys498), leading to enhanced kinase activity. Furthermore, they validated that estrogens could synergistically work with NOS to enhance cell migration and proliferation. β-estradiol stimulation of ER+ breast cancer cells induced c-Src S-nitrosation at Cys498, leading to the disruption of E-cadherin junctions and enhanced cellular invasion. Therefore, NO-mediated c-Src activation may be crucial for cancer cell dissemination.\n",

      "iNOS is capable of directly modulating PI3K/Akt signaling via S-nitrosation mechanisms, but the influence of these S-nitrosylated proteins on metastatic capacity has not been thoroughly investigated. In human breast cancer cells, Ridnour and colleagues found that iNOS-associated Akt phosphorylation required functional tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). Specifically, TIMP1 protein nitration and its protein–protein interaction with CD63 were observed in breast cancer cells that underwent NO-induced Akt activation. These findings suggest that breast tumors with elevated iNOS and TIMP1 expression exert their oncogenic function by Akt activation, leading to an aggressive phenotype. In melanoma, iNOS-derived NO can reversibly S-nitrosylate tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) protein, impairing TSC2/TSC1 dimerization, resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and enhanced proliferation of melanoma cells. Furthermore, in melanoma cell models, iNOS-derived NO can S-nitrosylate phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein, thereby attenuating PTEN phosphatase activity and stimulating PI3K/Akt signaling. Furthermore, iNOS expression is associated with worse overall survival in melanoma patients with intact PTEN expression in tumors, likely via iNOS-mediated stimulation of PI3K signaling. These findings present plausible mechanisms of how NO and nitrosative stress conditions can modulate the activation of prosurvival signaling pathways.\n",

      "S-nitrosation can also influence the mechanical properties of cells, as found in a study using a non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model. Ezrin, a cross-linker protein localized between microfilaments and the plasma membrane, is involved in intracellular mechanical activation crucial for cancer cell motility. Lung adenocarcinoma patients with tumors having high expression of iNOS or ezrin had lower overall survival than tumors with low ezrin or iNOS. Ezrin can be S-nitrosylated at the Cys117 site in in vitro and in vivo NSCLC models after exposure to NO. The Cys117 site is a key site for ezrin S-nitrosation that contributes to enhanced NSCLC invasion and metastasis. Specifically, S-nitrosation increases ezrin tension modulated by microfilament forces and is positively correlated with cancer aggressiveness. In salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC), the enhanced expression of Ezrin along with iNOS, CC44v6, and Ki67 protein expression is correlated with tumor histologic patterns, SACC metastases, and poor clinical outcomes.\n",

      "Studies within the past decade reported that NO signaling influences cancer stem cell (CSC) growth and tumorigenic functions. CSCs are a small subpopulation of pluripotent cells within solid and hematologic cancers. These cells are associated with cell proliferation, tumor development, and metastatic dissemination and possess the ability to self-renew. Relative to non–stem-like cancer cells, CSCs are typically chemo- and radioresistant. Resistant CSCs within the tumor may contribute to relapse and poor clinical response, despite these therapeutic modalities destroying a significant portion of the tumor bulk. The TME is a key contributor of molecules (e.g., NO), factors (e.g., TGFβ in active form), and cytokines responsible for CSC survival. Preclinical and clinical TNBC studies show that targeting NO with NOS inhibitors may target resistant CSC populations, thereby augmenting the efficacy of chemotherapy.\n",

This CD44+/CD24− MS gene signature was similar to a gene signature from human “claudin-low” breast cancers. These two gene signatures were predominantly found in residual tumor cells post-letrozole or docetaxel therapy and had a predominant expression of EMT genes. Residual breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) populations that survive after conventional therapy may have mesenchymal features and self-renewal capacity. Targeting proteins that alter EMT and/or BCSC survival may be an effective strategy to prevent recurrence, metastasis, and improve long-term survival.

In an HIF1α-independent manner, NOS inhibition reduced the expression of downstream proteins of NOS [(soluble guanylate cyclase (SCG) and cyclic-GMP-dependent kinase-1].

This finding supports other studies revealing that hypoxia promotes metastasis in an HIF1α-dependent manner and can also improve the number of cells expressing CD44 and its variant isoforms (CD44v6 and CD44v7/8), key BCSC markers.

      "EMT is a cellular process in which an epithelial cell with apical–basal polarity undergoes multiple biochemical changes to transition into a quasi-mesenchymal cell state. These mesenchymal-like cells have enhanced invasiveness, migratory capacity, resistance to apoptosis, stem-like features and produce extracellular matrix components. NO's influence on pro-and antimigratory properties of tumor cells mediated by EMT depends on NO concentration. Typically, elevated NO concentrations (500–2,000 nmol/L) repress EMT transcriptional programming, whereas intermediate-to-low NO concentrations (<500 nmol/L) are associated with cancer progression and invasiveness via enhanced EMT function. A high flux of NO prevents NF-κB activity by either S-nitrosation of the p50 subunit of NF-κB, reducing DNA-binding activity, or by inhibition of phosphorylation and dissociation of IκBα. Snail, a key EMT transcription factor, is transcriptionally induced by NF-κB but inhibited by E-cadherin and metastasis-suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP; ref.). In human metastatic prostate cancer cell lines treated with supraphysiological concentrations of NO via NO donor DETA NONOate, there was a reduction in Snail expression, upregulation of E-cadherin and RKIP, and a reversal of mesenchymal phenotype and cell invasive properties. In an alveolar epithelial cell model that recapitulates features of human interstitial lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia), exogenous NO reduces EMT (reduced collagen I and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression). In contrast, treatment with L-NAME (pan-NOS inhibitor) causes a spontaneous increase in EMT.\n",

      "The promigratory properties associated with NO signaling have also been reported in other studies. NO regulates EMT programming via modulating the expression of TGFβ, a critical inducer of EMT. In different cellular contexts, enhanced TGFβ expression correlates with increased iNOS expression, but it can also repress iNOS expression by activating the repressor complex TCF11/MafG. In an ER− breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468), NO treatment via DETA NONOate at intermediate flux concentrations (300–500 nmol/L) reduced cellular adhesion, increased cellular proliferation, enhanced chemoresistance, reduced expression of E-cadherin, and enhanced expression of vimentin, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and PGE2 relative to control. Another study supported these findings by showing that selective pharmacologic and siRNA-based inhibition of iNOS in TNBC breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and SUM159) leads to decreased cellular migration and reduced protein expression of EMT transcription factors (Snail, Slug, Twist1, and Zeb1; ref.). In TNBC cells, NOS inhibition represses EMT and cellular migration by impairing pathways that induce EMT, such as ER stress (IRE1α/XBP1 axis) and the TGFβ–ATF4–ATF3 axis.\n",

      "Other than targeting TGFβ and ER stress pathways, NO can also induce EMT via the induction of EGFR-dependent ERK phosphorylation. In human TNBC cell lines, NO-mediated activation of ERK signaling may be associated with enhanced cell migration/invasion, CSC maintenance, and EMT programming. Furthermore, in a prostate cancer model, chronic selection of normal prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells with DETA/NO led to a loss of E-cadherin and increased expression of vimentin, coupled with increased migratory and invasive phenotype, and increased proliferative capacity under serum-free conditions. This finding indicates that chronic NO exposure can lead to the acquisition of a protumorigenic phenotype in the prostate. These findings were further recapitulated in prostate cancer cells PC3 and DU145, thereby increasing further their invasive potential.\n",

      "Lui and colleagues evaluated the influence of iNOS in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) because ICC is often associated with diseases of chronic inflammation, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B/C viral infections, and alcohol abuse. The expression of iNOS was predominantly elevated in human ICC tissues compared with adjacent normal biliary tissue and was strongly associated with metastasis and poor differentiation. In ICC cell lines QBC939 and ICC9810, iNOS inhibition with 1400W small-molecule inhibitor resulted in decreased cellular invasion and migration, suggesting that iNOS partly facilitates ICC metastatic capacity. siRNA knockdown of NOS2 in ICC cell lines leads to decreased mRNA expression of MMP9, MMP2, and PPMI1D, genes involved in tumorigenicity and metastasis. Overall, these studies emphasize the nuanced and concentration-dependent complexity of the influence of NO on EMT and migratory capacity.\n",

      "A preventable risk factor associated with EMT, migratory capacity, and maintenance of CSC populations is obesity. In a study using murine models of claudin-low and basal-like breast cancer, dietary energy balance [calorie-restriction or diet-induced obesity (DIO)] differentially modulated EMT and tumor progression. DIO promoted tumor progression and EMT, as evidenced by enhanced expression of N-cadherin, fibronectin, and decreased expression of E-cadherin in mammary tumors. In both claudin-low and basal-like tumor models, DIO promoted the expression of EMT and tumor-initiating cell (TIC) genes, such as TGFβ, Snail, FOXC2, and Oct4, which are modulated by obesity-related growth factors. In murine syngeneic models of TNBC, high-fat-diet treatment is associated with enhanced tumoral hypoxia, neutrophil infiltration, decreased vascularity, EMT programming, and retention of tumor-initiating CSCs relative to mice treated with regular diet. These findings suggest that obesity-associated factors (that have yet to be identified) may be critically involved in promoting an aggressive TNBC phenotype in patients with obesity. Furthermore, fatty tissue inflammation associated with obesity results in the production of critical inflammatory modulators, such as COX2, prostaglandins (PG), and NO. These eicosanoids and inflammatory modulators are crucial for the development and growth of breast cancers, either via the production of aromatase for estrogen-dependent breast cancers or directly promoting an aggressive phenotype in estrogen-independent breast cancers [via NO and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production; refs. ].\n",

      "Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2, is a chronic disease and a growing public health concern, with adult obesity rates tripling since 1975 and continuing to rise worldwide. About one-third of the US population is obese, and an additional one-third is overweight, requiring $190 billion in healthcare expenditures. The link between obesity and cancer, particularly its influence on metastasis, has not been delineated. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), excess body fat was linked to 13 cancers, such as postmenopausal breast cancer. The current approach of utilizing BMI as a surrogate marker in relation to cancer risk may not completely capture the complexities associated with adipose TME and tumorigenesis. Instead, a better marker would be evaluating the quality of adipose tissue, particularly in response to body-weight gain or metabolic obesity. In metabolic obesity, adipocytes typically undergo hypertrophy/hyperplasia, increasing the demand for vascular supply. As the demand decreases, regions of fatty tissue become hypoxic, resulting in adipocyte stress/death and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) into the environment. DAMPs (such as free fatty acids, lipid metabolites, thioredoxin-interacting protein, s100 proteins, nucleic acids, cholesterol, and ATP) trigger an innate immune response (composed of dendritic cells, macrophages, and granulocytes), the formation of crown-like structures, and proinflammatory responses. These proinflammatory responses include the accumulation of proinflammatory molecules (TNFα, IFNγ, IL6, IL1β, and iNOS) and proinflammatory cells (granulocytes, B cells, and CD8+ T cells), resulting in a chronic inflammatory response. This obesity-associated chronic proinflammatory response enhances vascular inflammation and permeability, leading to cancer cell dissemination.\n",

      "In mouse models, obesity can lead to increased lung neutrophilia associated with experimental and spontaneous breast cancer metastasis to the lung in a neutrophil-dependent manner. This is likely due to an impairment in vascular integrity through loss of endothelial adhesions through obesity-induced lung neutrophils, resulting in cancer cell extravasation to the lung. McDowell and colleagues found that relative to neutrophils from lean mice, neutrophils from obese mice expressed genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as NOS2, and had low expression of genes essential for antioxidant activity as CAT. Specifically, neutrophil-produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, such as NO, increased the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), which weakened vascular integrity. Deleting NOS2 in diet-induced obese mice with breast cancer leads to an increase in JAM1+ vessels, reduced vascular permeability, and breast cancer extravasation. These findings suggest that obesity is associated with oxidative stress markers, such as NOS2 and NETosis, during lung metastases. Therefore, targeting these pathways with lifestyle modifications and NOS inhibitors may decrease metastatic risk in patients with obesity.\n",

      "There are a few preclinical studies that evaluated the benefit of combining NOS-targeted therapies with radiotherapy that are relevant to our discussion. Pereira and colleagues found that in a murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) model, radiotherapy leads to increased production of NO from cancer-associated fibroblasts, resulting in enhanced iNOS/NO signaling from PDAC tumor cells via NF-κB activation, and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Pharmacologic inhibition of NOS with the small-molecule inhibitor 1400W augmented therapeutic response to radiotherapy and decreased PDAC orthotopic tumor growth. Comparable findings were found in a preclinical study using a murine human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) model. In HNSCC syngeneic murine model, treatment with immunomodulatory agents cyclophosphamide (CTX) + iNOS inhibitor L-n6-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine (L-NIL) improved the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin + fractionated tumor-directed radiation, CRT) by remodeling the tumor myeloid immune microenvironment.

There are no NOS-based targeted therapies approved by the FDA. However, a few ongoing clinical trials have evaluated whether NOS inhibition via L-NMMA can boost the efficacy of taxane-based chemotherapies and immunotherapies and assess its influence on the TME (Table 3). For example, a first-in-class phase I/II clinical trial was conducted at Houston Methodist Hospital. L-NMMA combined with taxane-based chemotherapy was tested in patients with chemorefractory, locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and metastatic TNBC. The study found an overall response rate of 45.5%: 81.8% (9/11) for patients with LABC, 15.4% (2/13) for patients with metastatic TNBC, and three patients with LABC had a pathologic complete response at surgery (27.3%). Remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment was found in patients who responded to the combined therapy.

      "Despite many promising preclinical studies, there have been challenges contributing to the scarcity of clinical trials with NOS inhibitors. One example is that the biphasic role of NO complicates the regimen of choice for NO-based therapies, making this therapeutic strategy difficult in clinical settings. Another challenge is developing a standardized approach to decide what patients would benefit the most if NOS inhibitors were incorporated into their treatment arsenal and how would this decision be made. A set of robust, evidence-based biomarkers, such as iNOS IHC staining of tumor biopsy samples or tumor sequencing to detect RPL39 A14V/MLF2 R158W oncogenic mutations, might be needed to determine whether NOS inhibition should be considered. In human ER− breast tumors, high iNOS expression strongly correlates with increased TP53 mutation frequency. This may be mediated by NO inactivating p53 function, either via loss of DNA-binding activity or selecting for mutant TP53. Therefore, along with iNOS IHC staining, evaluating TP53 mutation status may also be worthwhile as a combined biomarker to determine whether a patient should receive a NOS inhibitor.\n",

Differences in the inducibility and relevance of NOS2 in rodents and humans may also contribute to why preclinical studies do not completely recapitulate clinical trial outcomes.

      "Another concern is the potential off-target effects associated with NOS inhibitors, particularly pan-NOS inhibitors such as L-NMMA. These can include hypertension and decreased cardiac output due to their inadvertent inhibition of the eNOS isoform. Cautionary tales from the negative results of the phase III TRIUMPH trial, in which L-NMMA was tested in patients with cardiogenic shock postmyocardial infarction, may have steered clinical trialists from using NOS inhibitors in other clinical settings. However, the early cessation of the TRIUMPH trial was because L-NMMA did not reduce overall mortality; however, L-NMMA was well tolerated with a safe toxicity profile. Although there are doubts about using nonselective NOS inhibitors for cardiogenic shock, repurposing its use in anticancer therapies should be considered. In a phase II clinical trial testing L-NMMA combined with taxane-based chemotherapy for chemorefractory and metastatic TNBC, no grade ≥3 toxicity was attributed to L-NMMA. The adverse events possibly attributed to L-NMMA were reported for 4/35 patients, which were pulmonary symptoms [grade 1 cough (n = 2), grade 1 dyspnea (n = 1), and grade 2 dyspnea (n = 2)]. L-NMMA-induced hypertension can be well managed with antihypertensive medications, such as amlodipine.

Many factors have been associated with enhanced tumor aggressiveness, metastases, and resistance to systemic/targeted therapies. Some of these factors include tumoral genetic/epigenetic alterations and rearrangement of tumor microenvironment (TME) components through dynamic and mutual cross-talk. Nitric oxide (NO) within the TME has gained interest for its influence on tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Various studies have revealed that NO can both promote and inhibit tumor progression and metastasis. However, NO's protumoral and antitumoral effects are primarily dependent on cellular sensitivity to NO, activity and localization of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), and concentration/duration of NO exposure. Therefore, it is warranted to discuss the nuanced influence NO plays on cancer metastasis and response to therapy.

These include modulating vascular function (vascular permeability, vasodilation, angiogenesis), neural system development, neurotransmission, heme signaling, smooth muscle relaxation, immune responses, platelet, and cytotoxic functions. NOSs are a family of enzymes that produce NO by converting L-arginine to L-citrulline and concomitantly produce NO. There are three NOS isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS/NOS1), endothelial NOS (eNOS/NOS3), and inducible NOS (iNOS/NOS2; ref.). These enzymes are numbered in the order the cDNAs were initially cloned. nNOS is constitutively expressed in neuronal cells and is crucial for neural signaling, whereas eNOS was first described in endothelial cells where it regulates vascular tone and angiogenesis. In a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner, eNOS/nNOS produce nanomolar concentrations of NO within seconds to minutes. iNOS differs from the eNOS/nNOS isoforms as cells typically do not express iNOS. Its expression is induced in response to proinflammatory molecules [interferon gamma (IFN\\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-1\\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\\u03b1), prostaglandins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)] and/or hypoxia, and iNOS generates micromolar concentrations with cellular effects that last for hours. Some of these proinflammatory NOS2 stimulants not only enhance the production of NO but also upregulate the production of key aggressive cancer markers, such as S100 calcium-binding protein, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1, IL6, and IL8.\"\n",

NO signaling is a function of NO concentration, and varied concentrations drive distinct signaling pathways. Within the TME, the influence of NO on protumor and antitumor functions is divided into three categories, depending on NO flux concentration: (i) cGMP-dependent signaling (<100 nmol/L NO), (ii) pro-oncogenic nitrosative signaling (50\\u2013300 nmol/L NO), and (iii) nitrosative stress signaling (500\\u20132,000 nmol/L NO; Fig. 1; refs.). This paradoxical role of NO within the TME is further complicated by NO's influence on innate and adaptive immune responses. NO can be derived from multiple cellular sources including tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages (predominately murine origin), fibroblasts, antigen-presenting cells, natural killer (NK) cells, etc.. In humans, iNOS was first cloned from epithelial cells (hepatocytes); therefore, it is not surprising that there is a role for iNOS in many cancers of epithelial origin. The cellular type, location, and number of cells expressing iNOS are critical determinants of enhanced tumorigenesis (e.g., colon carcinoma cells expressing iNOS are associated with enhanced tumor progression, whereas TME-associated leukocytes expressing iNOS are associated with reduced tumor progression; ref.). Altered S-nitrosation is crucial for promoting malignant phenotypes, including metastasis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, antiapoptotic signaling, genomic instability, and metabolic reprogramming (Fig. 2; refs.). In this review, we discuss how intermediate concentrations of NO influence key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways/proteins associated with cancer metastasis and therapy resistance.\"\n",

Using the MDA-MB-468 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, they showed that NO-induced S-nitrosation of wild-type Ras led to phosphorylation and activation of Ets via the Ras/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Knockdown of Ets inhibited NO-dependent expression of basal-like breast cancer markers (P-cadherin, S100A8, IL8, and \\u03b1\\u03b2-crystallin), attenuated NO-mediated matrix metalloprotease activity, and cancer cell invasion.

In a phase II clinical trial testing L-NMMA combined with taxane-based chemotherapy for chemorefractory and metastatic TNBC, no grade \\u22653 toxicity was attributed to L-NMMA. The adverse events possibly attributed to L-NMMA were reported for 4/35 patients, which were pulmonary symptoms [grade 1 cough (n = 2), grade 1 dyspnea (n = 1), and grade 2 dyspnea (n = 2)]. L-NMMA-induced hypertension can be well managed with antihypertensive medications, such as amlodipine. Further progress on appropriately utilizing NOS inhibitors in the clinical setting of oncology is still needed and should be seriously considered.\"\n",

These mesenchymal-like cells have enhanced invasiveness, migratory capacity, resistance to apoptosis, stem-like features and produce extracellular matrix components. NO's influence on pro-and antimigratory properties of tumor cells mediated by EMT depends on NO concentration. Typically, elevated NO concentrations (500\\u20132,000 nmol/L) repress EMT transcriptional programming, whereas intermediate-to-low NO concentrations (<500 nmol/L) are associated with cancer progression and invasiveness via enhanced EMT function. A high flux of NO prevents NF-\\u03baB activity by either S-nitrosation of the p50 subunit of NF-\\u03baB, reducing DNA-binding activity, or by inhibition of phosphorylation and dissociation of I\\u03baB\\u03b1. Snail, a key EMT transcription factor, is transcriptionally induced by NF-\\u03baB but inhibited by E-cadherin and metastasis-suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP; ref.). In human metastatic prostate cancer cell lines treated with supraphysiological concentrations of NO via NO donor DETA NONOate, there was a reduction in Snail expression, upregulation of E-cadherin and RKIP, and a reversal of mesenchymal phenotype and cell invasive properties. In an alveolar epithelial cell model that recapitulates features of human interstitial lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia), exogenous NO reduces EMT (reduced collagen I and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression). In contrast, treatment with L-NAME (pan-NOS inhibitor) causes a spontaneous increase in EMT.\"\n",

Another study supported these findings by showing that selective pharmacologic and siRNA-based inhibition of iNOS in TNBC breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and SUM159) leads to decreased cellular migration and reduced protein expression of EMT transcription factors (Snail, Slug, Twist1, and Zeb1; ref.).

In a study using murine models of claudin-low and basal-like breast cancer, dietary energy balance [calorie-restriction or diet-induced obesity (DIO)] differentially modulated EMT and tumor progression. DIO promoted tumor progression and EMT, as evidenced by enhanced expression of N-cadherin, fibronectin, and decreased expression of E-cadherin in mammary tumors. In both claudin-low and basal-like tumor models, DIO promoted the expression of EMT and tumor-initiating cell (TIC) genes, such as TGF\\u03b2, Snail, FOXC2, and Oct4, which are modulated by obesity-related growth factors. In murine syngeneic models of TNBC, high-fat-diet treatment is associated with enhanced tumoral hypoxia, neutrophil infiltration, decreased vascularity, EMT programming, and retention of tumor-initiating CSCs relative to mice treated with regular diet. These findings suggest that obesity-associated factors (that have yet to be identified) may be critically involved in promoting an aggressive TNBC phenotype in patients with obesity. Furthermore, fatty tissue inflammation associated with obesity results in the production of critical inflammatory modulators, such as COX2, prostaglandins (PG), and NO.

About one-third of the US population is obese, and an additional one-third is overweight, requiring $190 billion in healthcare expenditures. The link between obesity and cancer, particularly its influence on metastasis, has not been delineated. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), excess body fat was linked to 13 cancers, such as postmenopausal breast cancer. The current approach of utilizing BMI as a surrogate marker in relation to cancer risk may not completely capture the complexities associated with adipose TME and tumorigenesis. Instead, a better marker would be evaluating the quality of adipose tissue, particularly in response to body-weight gain or metabolic obesity. In metabolic obesity, adipocytes typically undergo hypertrophy/hyperplasia, increasing the demand for vascular supply. As the demand decreases, regions of fatty tissue become hypoxic, resulting in adipocyte stress/death and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) into the environment. DAMPs (such as free fatty acids, lipid metabolites, thioredoxin-interacting protein, s100 proteins, nucleic acids, cholesterol, and ATP) trigger an innate immune response (composed of dendritic cells, macrophages, and granulocytes), the formation of crown-like structures, and proinflammatory responses. These proinflammatory responses include the accumulation of proinflammatory molecules (TNF\\u03b1, IFN\\u03b3, IL6, IL1\\u03b2, and iNOS) and proinflammatory cells (granulocytes, B cells, and CD8+ T cells), resulting in a chronic inflammatory response.

This is likely due to an impairment in vascular integrity through loss of endothelial adhesions through obesity-induced lung neutrophils, resulting in cancer cell extravasation to the lung. McDowell and colleagues found that relative to neutrophils from lean mice, neutrophils from obese mice expressed genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as NOS2, and had low expression of genes essential for antioxidant activity as CAT. Specifically, neutrophil-produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, such as NO, increased the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), which weakened vascular integrity. Deleting NOS2 in diet-induced obese mice with breast cancer leads to an increase in JAM1+ vessels, reduced vascular permeability, and breast cancer extravasation. These findings suggest that obesity is associated with oxidative stress markers, such as NOS2 and NETosis, during lung metastases. Therefore, targeting these pathways with lifestyle modifications and NOS inhibitors may decrease metastatic risk in patients with obesity.\"\n",

Here, we reviewed the roles of NO as a critical molecule in regulating metastasis via PTMs, altering EMT programming, maintaining CSC populations, and driving obesity-associated metastasis. We also highlighted vital preclinical studies revealing that NOS inhibition can augment the efficacy of chemo/radiotherapy and immunotherapy in various solid tumors. Although a few emerging clinical trials evaluate NOS inhibitors as anticancer interventions, a more detailed understanding of NOS's biphasic role in tumor progression and standardized approaches to decide which patients with cancer would benefit the most from this therapeutic is necessary.\"\n",

       "  'Methods': ['In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.'],\n",
       "  'Results': ['A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.'],\n",
       "  'Conclusions': ['A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728.)']},\n",
       " 'INTRO': {'paragraph': ['Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has affected tens of millions of people globally since it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Older adults, persons with certain coexisting conditions, and front-line workers are at highest risk for Covid-19 and its complications. Recent data show increasing rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and Covid-19 in other populations, including younger adults. Safe and effective prophylactic vaccines are urgently needed to contain the pandemic, which has had devastating medical, economic, and social consequences.',\n",
       "   'We previously reported phase 1 safety and immunogenicity results from clinical trials of the vaccine candidate BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, modified by two proline mutations to lock it in the prefusion conformation. Findings from studies conducted in the United States and Germany among healthy men and women showed that two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2 elicited high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers and robust antigen-specific CD8+ and Th1-type CD4+ T-cell responses. The 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers elicited by 30 μg of BNT162b2 in older and younger adults exceeded the geometric mean titer measured in a human convalescent serum panel, despite a lower neutralizing response in older adults than in younger adults. In addition, the reactogenicity profile of BNT162b2 represented mainly short-term local (i.e., injection site) and systemic responses. These findings supported progression of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate into phase 3.',\n",
       "   'Here, we report safety and efficacy findings from the phase 2/3 part of a global phase 1/2/3 trial evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of 30 μg of BNT162b2 in preventing Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. This data set and these trial results are the basis for an application for emergency use authorization. Collection of phase 2/3 data on vaccine immunogenicity and the durability of the immune response to immunization is ongoing, and those data are not reported here.']},\n",
       " 'METHODS': {'Trial Objectives, Participants and Oversight': ['We assessed the safety and efficacy of two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2, administered intramuscularly 21 days apart, as compared with placebo. Adults 16 years of age or older who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions, including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus infection, were eligible for participation in the trial. Key exclusion criteria included a medical history of Covid-19, treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, or diagnosis with an immunocompromising condition.',\n",
       "   'Pfizer was responsible for the design and conduct of the trial, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and the writing of the manuscript. BioNTech was the sponsor of the trial, manufactured the BNT162b2 clinical trial material, and contributed to the interpretation of the data and the writing of the manuscript. All the trial data were available to all the authors, who vouch for its accuracy and completeness and for adherence of the trial to the protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed efficacy and unblinded safety data.'],\n",
       "  'Trial Procedures': ['With the use of an interactive Web-based system, participants in the trial were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 30 μg of BNT162b2 (0.3 ml volume per dose) or saline placebo. Participants received two injections, 21 days apart, of either BNT162b2 or placebo, delivered in the deltoid muscle. Site staff who were responsible for safety evaluation and were unaware of group assignments observed participants for 30 minutes after vaccination for any acute reactions.'],\n",
       "  'Safety': ['The primary end points of this trial were solicited, specific local or systemic adverse events and use of antipyretic or pain medication within 7 days after the receipt of each dose of vaccine or placebo, as prompted by and recorded in an electronic diary in a subset of participants (the reactogenicity subset), and unsolicited adverse events (those reported by the participants without prompts from the electronic diary) through 1 month after the second dose and unsolicited serious adverse events through 6 months after the second dose. Adverse event data through approximately 14 weeks after the second dose are included in this report. In this report, safety data are reported for all participants who provided informed consent and received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. Per protocol, safety results for participants infected with HIV (196 patients) will be analyzed separately and are not included here.',\n",
       "   'During the phase 2/3 portion of the study, a stopping rule for the theoretical concern of vaccine-enhanced disease was to be triggered if the one-sided probability of observing the same or a more unfavorable adverse severe case split (a split with a greater proportion of severe cases in vaccine recipients) was 5% or less, given the same true incidence for vaccine and placebo recipients. Alert criteria were to be triggered if this probability was less than 11%.'],\n",
       "  'Efficacy': ['The first primary end point was the efficacy of BNT162b2 against confirmed Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose in participants who had been without serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 7 days after the second dose; the second primary end point was efficacy in participants with and participants without evidence of prior infection. Confirmed Covid-19 was defined according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria as the presence of at least one of the following symptoms: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting, combined with a respiratory specimen obtained during the symptomatic period or within 4 days before or after it that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification–based testing, either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility (using a protocol-defined acceptable test).',\n",
       "   'Major secondary end points included the efficacy of BNT162b2 against severe Covid-19. Severe Covid-19 is defined by the FDA as confirmed Covid-19 with one of the following additional features: clinical signs at rest that are indicative of severe systemic illness; respiratory failure; evidence of shock; significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; admission to an intensive care unit; or death. Details are provided in the protocol.',\n",
       "   'An explanation of the various denominator values for use in assessing the results of the trial is provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. In brief, the safety population includes persons 16 years of age or older; a total of 43,448 participants constituted the population of enrolled persons injected with the vaccine or placebo. The main safety subset as defined by the FDA, with a median of 2 months of follow-up as of October 9, 2020, consisted of 37,706 persons, and the reactogenicity subset consisted of 8183 persons. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) efficacy population includes all age groups 12 years of age or older (43,355 persons; 100 participants who were 12 to 15 years of age contributed to person-time years but included no cases). The number of persons who could be evaluated for efficacy 7 days after the second dose and who had no evidence of prior infection was 36,523, and the number of persons who could be evaluated 7 days after the second dose with or without evidence of prior infection was 40,137.'],\n",
       "  'Statistical Analysis': ['The safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 or placebo. The findings are descriptive in nature and not based on formal statistical hypothesis testing. Safety analyses are presented as counts, percentages, and associated Clopper–Pearson 95% confidence intervals for local reactions, systemic events, and any adverse events after vaccination, according to terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 23.1, for each vaccine group.',\n",
       "   'Analysis of the first primary efficacy end point included participants who received the vaccine or placebo as randomly assigned, had no evidence of infection within 7 days after the second dose, and had no major protocol deviations (the population that could be evaluated). Vaccine efficacy was estimated by 100×(1−IRR), where IRR is the calculated ratio of confirmed cases of Covid-19 illness per 1000 person-years of follow-up in the active vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. The 95.0% credible interval for vaccine efficacy and the probability of vaccine efficacy greater than 30% were calculated with the use of a Bayesian beta-binomial model. The final analysis uses a success boundary of 98.6% for probability of vaccine efficacy greater than 30% to compensate for the interim analysis and to control the overall type 1 error rate at 2.5%. Moreover, primary and secondary efficacy end points are evaluated sequentially to control the familywise type 1 error rate at 2.5%. Descriptive analyses (estimates of vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals) are provided for key subgroups.']},\n",
       " 'RESULTS': {'Participants': ['Between July 27, 2020, and November 14, 2020, a total of 44,820 persons were screened, and 43,548 persons 16 years of age or older underwent randomization at 152 sites worldwide (United States, 130 sites; Argentina, 1; Brazil, 2; South Africa, 4; Germany, 6; and Turkey, 9) in the phase 2/3 portion of the trial. A total of 43,448 participants received injections: 21,720 received BNT162b2 and 21,728 received placebo (Figure 1). At the data cut-off date of October 9, a total of 37,706 participants had a median of at least 2 months of safety data available after the second dose and contributed to the main safety data set. Among these 37,706 participants, 49% were female, 83% were White, 9% were Black or African American, 28% were Hispanic or Latinx, 35% were obese (body mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters] of at least 30.0), and 21% had at least one coexisting condition. The median age was 52 years, and 42% of participants were older than 55 years of age (Table 1 and Table S2).'],\n",
       "  'Local Reactogenicity': ['The reactogenicity subset included 8183 participants. Overall, BNT162b2 recipients reported more local reactions than placebo recipients. Among BNT162b2 recipients, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site within 7 days after an injection was the most commonly reported local reaction, with less than 1% of participants across all age groups reporting severe pain (Figure 2). Pain was reported less frequently among participants older than 55 years of age (71% reported pain after the first dose; 66% after the second dose) than among younger participants (83% after the first dose; 78% after the second dose). A noticeably lower percentage of participants reported injection-site redness or swelling. The proportion of participants reporting local reactions did not increase after the second dose (Figure 2A), and no participant reported a grade 4 local reaction. In general, local reactions were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 2 days.'],\n",
       "  'Systemic Reactogenicity': ['Systemic events were reported more often by younger vaccine recipients (16 to 55 years of age) than by older vaccine recipients (more than 55 years of age) in the reactogenicity subset and more often after dose 2 than dose 1 (Figure 2B). The most commonly reported systemic events were fatigue and headache (59% and 52%, respectively, after the second dose, among younger vaccine recipients; 51% and 39% among older recipients), although fatigue and headache were also reported by many placebo recipients (23% and 24%, respectively, after the second dose, among younger vaccine recipients; 17% and 14% among older recipients). The frequency of any severe systemic event after the first dose was 0.9% or less. Severe systemic events were reported in less than 2% of vaccine recipients after either dose, except for fatigue (in 3.8%) and headache (in 2.0%) after the second dose.',\n",
       "   'Fever (temperature, ≥38°C) was reported after the second dose by 16% of younger vaccine recipients and by 11% of older recipients. Only 0.2% of vaccine recipients and 0.1% of placebo recipients reported fever (temperature, 38.9 to 40°C) after the first dose, as compared with 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively, after the second dose. Two participants each in the vaccine and placebo groups reported temperatures above 40.0°C. Younger vaccine recipients were more likely to use antipyretic or pain medication (28% after dose 1; 45% after dose 2) than older vaccine recipients (20% after dose 1; 38% after dose 2), and placebo recipients were less likely (10 to 14%) than vaccine recipients to use the medications, regardless of age or dose. Systemic events including fever and chills were observed within the first 1 to 2 days after vaccination and resolved shortly thereafter.',\n",
       "   'Daily use of the electronic diary ranged from 90 to 93% for each day after the first dose and from 75 to 83% for each day after the second dose. No difference was noted between the BNT162b2 group and the placebo group.'],\n",
       "  'Adverse Events': ['Adverse event analyses are provided for all enrolled 43,252 participants, with variable follow-up time after dose 1 (Table S3). More BNT162b2 recipients than placebo recipients reported any adverse event (27% and 12%, respectively) or a related adverse event (21% and 5%). This distribution largely reflects the inclusion of transient reactogenicity events, which were reported as adverse events more commonly by vaccine recipients than by placebo recipients. Sixty-four vaccine recipients (0.3%) and 6 placebo recipients (<0.1%) reported lymphadenopathy. Few participants in either group had severe adverse events, serious adverse events, or adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Four related serious adverse events were reported among BNT162b2 recipients (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration, right axillary lymphadenopathy, paroxysmal ventricular arrhythmia, and right leg paresthesia). Two BNT162b2 recipients died (one from arteriosclerosis, one from cardiac arrest), as did four placebo recipients (two from unknown causes, one from hemorrhagic stroke, and one from myocardial infarction). No deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to the vaccine or placebo. No Covid-19–associated deaths were observed. No stopping rules were met during the reporting period. Safety monitoring will continue for 2 years after administration of the second dose of vaccine.'],\n",
       "  'Efficacy': ['Among 36,523 participants who had no evidence of existing or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose were observed among vaccine recipients and 162 among placebo recipients. This case split corresponds to 95.0% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.3 to 97.6; Table 2). Among participants with and those without evidence of prior SARS CoV-2 infection, 9 cases of Covid-19 at least 7 days after the second dose were observed among vaccine recipients and 169 among placebo recipients, corresponding to 94.6% vaccine efficacy (95% CI, 89.9 to 97.3). Supplemental analyses indicated that vaccine efficacy among subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, obesity, and presence of a coexisting condition was generally consistent with that observed in the overall population (Table 3 and Table S4). Vaccine efficacy among participants with hypertension was analyzed separately but was consistent with the other subgroup analyses (vaccine efficacy, 94.6%; 95% CI, 68.7 to 99.9; case split: BNT162b2, 2 cases; placebo, 44 cases). Figure 3 shows cases of Covid-19 or severe Covid-19 with onset at any time after the first dose (mITT population) (additional data on severe Covid-19 are available in Table S5). Between the first dose and the second dose, 39 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 82 cases in the placebo group were observed, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 52% (95% CI, 29.5 to 68.4) during this interval and indicating early protection by the vaccine, starting as soon as 12 days after the first dose.']},\n",
       " 'DISCUSS': {'Discussion': ['A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 (30 μg per dose, given 21 days apart) was found to be safe and 95% effective against Covid-19. The vaccine met both primary efficacy end points, with more than a 99.99% probability of a true vaccine efficacy greater than 30%. These results met our prespecified success criteria, which were to establish a probability above 98.6% of true vaccine efficacy being greater than 30%, and greatly exceeded the minimum FDA criteria for authorization. Although the study was not powered to definitively assess efficacy by subgroup, the point estimates of efficacy for subgroups based on age, sex, race, ethnicity, body-mass index, or the presence of an underlying condition associated with a high risk of Covid-19 complications are also high. For all analyzed subgroups in which more than 10 cases of Covid-19 occurred, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for efficacy was more than 30%.',\n",
       "   'The cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients begins to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, 7 days after the estimated median viral incubation period of 5 days, indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. The study was not designed to assess the efficacy of a single-dose regimen. Nevertheless, in the interval between the first and second doses, the observed vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 52%, and in the first 7 days after dose 2, it was 91%, reaching full efficacy against disease with onset at least 7 days after dose 2. Of the 10 cases of severe Covid-19 that were observed after the first dose, only 1 occurred in the vaccine group. This finding is consistent with overall high efficacy against all Covid-19 cases. The severe case split provides preliminary evidence of vaccine-mediated protection against severe disease, alleviating many of the theoretical concerns over vaccine-mediated disease enhancement.',\n",
       "   'The favorable safety profile observed during phase 1 testing of BNT162b2 was confirmed in the phase 2/3 portion of the trial. As in phase 1, reactogenicity was generally mild or moderate, and reactions were less common and milder in older adults than in younger adults. Systemic reactogenicity was more common and severe after the second dose than after the first dose, although local reactogenicity was similar after the two doses. Severe fatigue was observed in approximately 4% of BNT162b2 recipients, which is higher than that observed in recipients of some vaccines recommended for older adults. This rate of severe fatigue is also lower than that observed in recipients of another approved viral vaccine for older adults. Overall, reactogenicity events were transient and resolved within a couple of days after onset. Lymphadenopathy, which generally resolved within 10 days, is likely to have resulted from a robust vaccine-elicited immune response. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups (0.6% and 0.5%, respectively).',\n",
       "   'This trial and its preliminary report have several limitations. With approximately 19,000 participants per group in the subset of participants with a median follow-up time of 2 months after the second dose, the study has more than 83% probability of detecting at least one adverse event, if the true incidence is 0.01%, but it is not large enough to detect less common adverse events reliably. This report includes 2 months of follow-up after the second dose of vaccine for half the trial participants and up to 14 weeks’ maximum follow-up for a smaller subset. Therefore, both the occurrence of adverse events more than 2 to 3.5 months after the second dose and more comprehensive information on the duration of protection remain to be determined. Although the study was designed to follow participants for safety and efficacy for 2 years after the second dose, given the high vaccine efficacy, ethical and practical barriers prevent following placebo recipients for 2 years without offering active immunization, once the vaccine is approved by regulators and recommended by public health authorities. Assessment of long-term safety and efficacy for this vaccine will occur, but it cannot be in the context of maintaining a placebo group for the planned follow-up period of 2 years after the second dose. These data do not address whether vaccination prevents asymptomatic infection; a serologic end point that can detect a history of infection regardless of whether symptoms were present (SARS-CoV-2 N-binding antibody) will be reported later. Furthermore, given the high vaccine efficacy and the low number of vaccine breakthrough cases, potential establishment of a correlate of protection has not been feasible at the time of this report.',\n",
       "   'This report does not address the prevention of Covid-19 in other populations, such as younger adolescents, children, and pregnant women. Safety and immune response data from this trial after immunization of adolescents 12 to 15 years of age will be reported subsequently, and additional studies are planned to evaluate BNT162b2 in pregnant women, children younger than 12 years, and those in special risk groups, such as immunocompromised persons. Although the vaccine can be stored for up to 5 days at standard refrigerator temperatures once ready for use, very cold temperatures are required for shipping and longer storage. The current cold storage requirement may be alleviated by ongoing stability studies and formulation optimization, which may also be described in subsequent reports.',\n",
       "   'The data presented in this report have significance beyond the performance of this vaccine candidate. The results demonstrate that Covid-19 can be prevented by immunization, provide proof of concept that RNA-based vaccines are a promising new approach for protecting humans against infectious diseases, and demonstrate the speed with which an RNA-based vaccine can be developed with a sufficient investment of resources. The development of BNT162b2 was initiated on January 10, 2020, when the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence was released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and disseminated globally by the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) initiative. This rigorous demonstration of safety and efficacy less than 11 months later provides a practical demonstration that RNA-based vaccines, which require only viral genetic sequence information to initiate development, are a major new tool to combat pandemics and other infectious disease outbreaks. The continuous phase 1/2/3 trial design may provide a model to reduce the protracted development timelines that have delayed the availability of vaccines against other infectious diseases of medical importance. In the context of the current, still expanding pandemic, the BNT162b2 vaccine, if approved, can contribute, together with other public health measures, to reducing the devastating loss of health, life, and economic and social well-being that has resulted from the global spread of Covid-19.',\n",
