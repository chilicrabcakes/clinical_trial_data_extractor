Additionally, patients who completed MBCT showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms. Reasons for non\u2010completion should be further investigated."]]}, "INTRO": {"INTRODUCTION": [["Major depressive disorder is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (Lopez, Mathers, Ezzati, Jamison, & Murray, 2006). Despite evidence\u2010based treatments, about 20% of all depressed patients develop a chronic course (Kessler et\u00a0al., 2003), typically defined as a period of 2 years or longer of depressive symptoms (DSM\u2010IV\u2010TR, 2000). Chronic depression not only affects the personal life of a patient, but is also associated with high costs for society in terms of health care costs and workplace losses (Pincus, 2001). Unfortunately, a large number of chronically depressed patients do not respond to treatment (Torpey & Klein, 2008). Therefore, novel treatment strategies for this severely ill population are much needed (Cuijpers, Huibers, & Furukawa, 2017)."], ["Surprisingly, no unified definition of treatment\u2010resistant depression exists. Staging methods to measure treatment resistance mostly focus on the number of biological treatment steps (Trevino, McClintock, Fischer, Vora, & Husain, 2014). In line with these staging methods, most clinical trials define a depressive episode as treatment\u2010resistant if two or more trials with antidepressant medication were unsuccessful (Rush, Thase, & Dub\u00e9, 2003; Trevino et\u00a0al., 2014). However, this definition conflicts with multidisciplinary treatment guidelines (NICE, 2009), which state that depressed patients with moderate to severe symptoms should receive a combination of psychological and pharmacological treatments. Therefore, a new staging method to measure treatment resistance was developed, which is termed as the \u201cDutch Measure for quantification of Treatment Resistance in Depression\u201d (DM\u2010TRD) (Peeters et\u00a0al., 2016). In contrast to previous staging methods (Fekadu, Wooderson, Donaldson, et\u00a0al., 2009; Fekadu, Wooderson, Markopoulou, & Cleare, 2009; Petersen et\u00a0al., 2005; Souery et\u00a0al., 1999; Thase & Rush, 1997), the DM\u2010TRD not only focuses on biological treatments but also includes evidence\u2010based psychological treatments. For these reasons, we have chosen to apply the criteria of the DM\u2010TRD for treatment resistance in the current study."], ["Mindfulness\u2010based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an 8\u2010week group training that combines mindfulness meditation techniques with elements of cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2012). MBCT teaches participants to recognize and disengage from maladaptive automatic cognitive patterns, and to develop a nonjudgmental and compassionate attitude toward their own cognitions and feelings. MBCT has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing relapse (Kuyken et\u00a0al., 2016). In addition, it has been shown that MBCT reduces depressive symptoms in currently depressed patients (Strauss, Cavanagh, Oliver, & Pettman, 2014). Preliminary studies (Barnhofer Crane, Hargus, Amarasinghe, Winder, & Williams, 2009; Eisendrath et\u00a0al., 2008; Kenny & Williams, 2007) have even found beneficial effects of MBCT for patients with chronic or treatment\u2010resistant depression. In line with these findings, in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Eisendrath et\u00a0al. (2016) in treatment\u2010resistant depressed patients, MBCT was demonstrated to be superior to an active control group matched on treatment intensity. However, partly contrasting results were found by Michalak, Probst, Heidenreich, Bissantz, and Schramm (2016) in an RCT comparing MBCT with Cognitive Behavioural Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) and treatment\u2010as\u2010usual (TAU) in chronically depressed patients. CBASP is a psychological treatment with a strong interpersonal orientation that focuses on overcoming the learned helplessness of the patient by teaching patients that their own behavior affects others and themselves (McCullough, 2003). Michalak et\u00a0al. (2016) concluded that MBCT was inferior to CBASP, and MBCT was superior to TAU only at one treatment site."], ["Importantly, all available controlled studies about MBCT for treatment\u2010resistant depression focused on pharmacoresistant depressed patients (Eisendrath et\u00a0al., 2008, 2016). It therefore remains unclear whether MBCT is effective in chronically depressed patients who have been treated according to treatment guidelines (i.e., received evidence\u2010based psychological treatment and pharmacotherapy) but have not responded."], ["The aim of the current study was to investigate the effectiveness of MBCT + TAU versus TAU only for chronically depressed patients with current moderate to severe depressive symptoms who have not responded to previous pharmacotherapy and evidenced\u2010based psychological treatments, that is, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT). The primary outcome measure was the level of depressive symptoms. Secondary outcome measures were remission rates, rumination, quality of life, mindfulness skills, and self\u2010compassion. Additionally, we examined the following variables as potential moderators of treatment effect gender, age, childhood trauma, number of previous episodes, duration of current depressive episode, treatment resistance, baseline levels of depressive symptoms, rumination, mindfulness skills, and self\u2010compassion."]]}, "METHODS": {"Design": [["This trial was an open\u2010labeled, multicenter RCT comparing two groups: MBCT + TAU and TAU. Methods and procedures are fully described in the published protocol (Cladder\u2010Micus et\u00a0al., 2015) and are summarized below. All participants gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Arnhem\u2010Nijmegen (number 2012/339)."]], "Participants": [["Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0106) were recruited at different locations of a local mental health institute (Pro Persona) and a university medical center (Radboud University Medical Center, Centre for Mindfulness). Participants were referred by mental health care professionals or recruited via flyers, posters, and websites. Clinicians were also explicitly asked to screen their caseload for potentially eligible participants. A depressive episode was defined as \u201cchronic\u201d if symptoms persisted for \u226512 months, because research has shown that chances of recovery decrease substantially after this period (Spijker et\u00a0al., 2002). Inclusion criteria were (a) age \u2265 18, (b) current depressive episode according to DSM\u2010IV criteria with a duration of \u226512 months, (c) moderate to high levels of depressive symptoms (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology\u2010Self\u2010Report [IDS\u2010SR] \u2265 21), (d) at least one adequate trial of antidepressant medication during the current episode (defined as appropriate doses of antidepressant medication for \u22654\u00a0weeks or patient's refusal to use medication contrary to the advice of a psychiatrist), and (e) previous psychological treatment during the current episode (defined as \u226510 sessions of CBT or IPT or\u00a0<\u00a010 sessions if discontinued because of patient's withdrawal). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) current psychotic symptoms; (b) lifetime bipolar disorder; (c) current alcohol or drug dependence; (d) recent electro convulsive therapy (<\u00a03 months ago); (e) current somatic disorder partly explaining depressive symptoms; (f) physical, linguistic, cognitive, or intellectual impairments, which might interfere with participation in MBCT or assessments; and (g) previous MBCT training. Baseline characteristics can be found in Table\u00a01."]], "Procedure": [["Interested patients received an information letter and were contacted via telephone. During a subsequent research interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, Sheehan et\u00a0al., 1998) was administered to diagnose depressive, anxiety, psychotic, and addictive disorders according to DSM\u2010IV criteria. In addition, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were assessed, including treatment resistance (DM\u2010TRD, Peeters et\u00a0al., 2016) and childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; Bernstein et\u00a0al., 2003). The DM\u2010TRD includes domains such as duration and severity of symptoms, comorbid anxiety disorders, functional impairments, previous biological treatments, and previous psychological treatments. After completion of the baseline measures, participants were randomized to MBCT + TAU or TAU only by means of a web\u2010based application that was specifically designed for this study by an independent statistician. Randomization was 1:1 to MBCT + TAU or TAU only, stratified for treatment center, and minimized for the severity of depressive symptoms (IDS\u2010SR: 21\u201331; 32\u201339;\u00a0>\u00a040) and chronicity (1\u20132 years, \u22652 years), without using block randomization. If due to scheduling constraints the time between baseline assessment and start of MBCT exceeded 4\u00a0weeks, a second baseline assessment was conducted before MBCT started. Participants assigned to the TAU condition were offered MBCT after completion of posttreatment measures. Follow\u2010up data were collected at 3 and 6 months after completing MBCT. Additionally, a subsample (N\u00a0=\u00a086) was invited to participate in experimental tasks during baseline and posttreatment to assess biased information processing. These data focus on different research questions and will be presented separately. Data presented here were collected between January 2013 and April 2016."]], "MBCT + TAU": [["MBCT was based on the manual by Segal, Williams, and Teasdale (2002) and consisted of 8 weekly 2.5\u2010hr sessions and 1 day of practice (day of silence). Participants were enrolled in MBCT courses that were part of the regular treatment program for patients with depressive disorders. The average number of study participants was 2.41 (SD\u00a0=\u00a01.55) per MBCT group of 8\u201312 patients. Mindfulness trainers were informed about enrollment of participants in the study, but were pressed to adopt an identical approach and procedure for all patients. Group members were not informed about study participation of individual fellow members, but participants were of course allowed to share this information at will. All mindfulness trainers were highly experienced in working with depressed patients and had completed a postgraduate 2\u2010year mindfulness teacher training. Thereby they met the advanced criteria of good practice guidelines of the UK Network for Mindfulness\u2010Based Teachers (Network, 2011). Teacher competence and adherence was assessed with the Mindfulness\u2010Based Interventions\u2010Teaching Assessment Criteria (Crane et\u00a0al., 2012) based on two video recorded sessions per trainer. Two independent mindfulness trainers rated the trainers. Mutually agreed ratings of the trainers were \u201cproficient\u201d (n\u00a0=\u00a02), \u201cproficient/competent\u201d (n\u00a0=\u00a01), \u201ccompetent\u201d (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and \u201cadvanced beginner\u201d (n\u00a0=\u00a01).

There were no significant differences between conditions in the mean number of treatment sessions or in the number of patients who received these treatments (see Table\u00a02). Medication levels at baseline can be found in Table\u00a01. A minority of participants changed in medication level. This information is summarized in Table\u00a02 and additional information can be found in the Supporting Information Table 1."]], "Primary outcome measure": [["The primary outcome was the level of depressive symptoms assessed with IDS\u2010SR (Rush, Gullion, Basco, Jarrett, & Trivedi, 1996).

Remission was defined as the absence of depressive symptoms during the last 2\u00a0weeks. Participants reporting some symptoms but not fulfilling DSM\u2010IV criteria according to the MINI were classified as being in partial remission. The interviews were administered by trained research psychologists supervised by an experienced psychiatrist (AS) and were audio recorded. For logistical reasons, it was not possible to keep the research psychologists blind to treatment allocation. A random sample (n\u00a0=\u00a025) of the recorded MINI depression modules was scored by an independent psychologist blind to condition, who was extensively trained in the administration of the MINI. This yielded a high interrater reliability (Cohen's kappa 0.88)."], ["Rumination was assessed with the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS\u2010EXT; Raes & Hermans, 2007; Schoofs, Hermans, & Raes, 2010). Quality of life was assessed with the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (Skevington, Lotfy, & O'Connell, 2004). Mindfulness skills and self\u2010compassion were assessed with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et\u00a0al., 2008) and the Self\u2010Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003), respectively. More information about these secondary outcome measures can be found in the published study protocol (Cladder\u2010Micus et\u00a0al., 2015, pp. 5\u20136)."]], "Statistical analysis": [["The power calculation was based on a Cohen's d effect size of 0.53 for currently depressed patients as reported in a previous study (van Aalderen et\u00a0al., 2011). Based on an \u03b1 of 0.05 and power of 80%, estimating the correlation between baseline and posttreatment scores to be 0.5, and expecting a drop\u2010out of 8 participants, a required sample size of 94 participants emerged (Cladder\u2010Micus et\u00a0al., 2015). For the main analysis, posttreatment scores of depressive symptoms were compared between the two conditions in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for baseline scores of depression, chronicity (1\u20132 years; \u22652 years), and treatment site. Similar analyses were conducted for the secondary outcome measures, controlling for baseline scores of the respective variable, chronicity (1\u20132 years; \u22652 years), and treatment site. A Cohen's d effect size was calculated based on the total group's (n\u00a0=\u00a0106) standard deviation on the IDS\u2010SR at baseline. A statistical significance level of 0.05 was adhered to for all analyses. Moderating effects of gender, age, childhood trauma, number of previous episodes, duration of current depressive episode treatment resistance, baseline levels of depressive symptoms, rumination, mindfulness skills, and self\u2010compassion were explored in the intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) sample by incorporating interaction effects in the models. Posttreatment IDS\u2010SR scores were missing for 10 participants (9.4%, TAU: n\u00a0=\u00a05, MBCT + TAU: n\u00a0=\u00a05). There were no differences in clinical or baseline characteristics between patients with and without posttreatment IDS\u2010SR scores, except that the patients with missing scores reported a higher number of previous depressive episodes (M\u00a0=\u00a05.00, SD\u00a0=\u00a08.90, t (102)\u00a0=\u00a0\u20132.32, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) than complete cases (M\u00a0=\u00a02.45, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.07). For two patients without posttreatment scores, follow\u2010up scores were used. Analyses were based on an ITT approach including all available data. Next, analyses were repeated in the per\u2010protocol (PP) sample, including participants of MBCT + TAU who attended \u22654 sessions and participants of TAU.

Twenty\u2010six (53.0%) MBCT + TAU participants completed a second baseline because time from randomization to MBCT exceeded 4\u00a0weeks and no significant changes in depressive symptoms between the first and second baseline were observed (M baseline1\u00a0=\u00a041.15, SD baseline1\u00a0=\u00a07.86, M baseline2\u00a0=\u00a040.38, SD baseline2\u00a0=\u00a09.99; t (25)\u00a0=\u00a00.47, P\u00a0=\u00a00.64). None of the participants of the TAU condition took part in MBCT or other mindfulness\u2010based training. Twelve participants of the MBCT + TAU condition (24.5%) attended fewer than four sessions of MBCT and were classified as non\u2010completers. The other participants (completers) attended on average 7.09 (SD\u00a0=\u00a01.15) out of the eight MBCT sessions. The most prevalent reason for drop\u2010out was the occurrence or deterioration of physical problems (see Figure\u00a01). Non\u2010completers reported a shorter duration of the current depressive episode (M\u00a0=\u00a060.05 months, SD\u00a0=\u00a071.72) than completers (M\u00a0=\u00a093.18 months, SD\u00a0=\u00a056.22; U\u00a0=\u00a0246.5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and they were more often unemployed (\u03c7 2 (5)\u00a0=\u00a08.60, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). There were no other significant differences in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics between non\u2010completers and completers (see Table\u00a02 in the Supporting Information). No serious adverse events occurred."]], "Primary outcome": [["Depression scores were analyzed separately for the ITT sample and the PP sample. In both analyses, the MBCT + TAU condition showed lower levels of depressive symptoms than TAU, with small to medium effect sizes.

Sensitivity analyses using the LOCF sample led to similar findings.

However, most cases were classified as partial remission (MBCT + TAU: 39.0%; TAU: 17.65%) and a minority as full remission (MBCT + TAU: 2.44%; TAU: 3.92%). Compared to TAU, the MBCT + TAU condition showed significantly less rumination (d\u00a0=\u00a00.39, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and significantly higher quality of life (d\u00a0=\u00a00.42, P\u00a0=\u00a00.048) at posttreatment, controlling for baseline scores. Additionally, participants with MBCT + TAU showed significantly more mindfulness skills (d\u00a0=\u00a00.73, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and significantly more self\u2010compassion (d\u00a0=\u00a00.64, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) than participants with TAU only. Analyses in the PP sample yielded comparable results (see Tables\u00a03 and 4)."]], "Moderation analyses": [["There were no significant moderators for the effect of condition on depressive symptoms in the ITT sample, apart from baseline levels of rumination (F (1, 84)\u00a0=\u00a05.44, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Participants with higher baseline rumination showed a significantly larger decrease in depressive symptoms in the MBCT + TAU condition compared to TAU, while controlling for depressive symptoms on baseline. In an exploratory analysis, participants were grouped based on a previously published clinical mean of the RRS\u2010EXT (Raes et\u00a0al., 2009). In the group of participants scoring above the clinical mean for rumination, participants assigned to MBCT + TAU showed significantly lower depressive symptoms compared to TAU (\u201310.79, 95% CI [\u201315.72 to \u20135.85], d\u00a0=\u00a01.64, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001; MBCT + TAU n\u00a0=\u00a017, TAU n\u00a0=\u00a022) posttreatment while controlling for baseline depressive symptoms, whereas no difference between MBCT + TAU and TAU was observed in the group of participants scoring below the clinical mean (1.47, 95% CI [\u20134.38 to 7.33], d\u00a0=\u00a00.24, P\u00a0=\u00a00.62; MBCT + TAU n\u00a0=\u00a022, TAU n\u00a0=\u00a030).

The results of the ITT analysis did not confirm the expected reduction in depressive symptoms. However, completers of the MBCT + TAU did show a significant decrease in depressive symptoms compared to TAU. Further, according to the ITT analyses, more participants in the MBCT + TAU condition reached partial remission and MBCT + TAU participants reported less rumination and increased quality of life, mindfulness skills, and self\u2010compassion compared to participants receiving TAU only."], ["The finding that the decrease in depressive symptoms was significant only in the PP analysis and not in the ITT analysis can be partially explained by the relatively high proportion of patients not completing MBCT (n\u00a0=\u00a012, 24.5%). This percentage is comparable to other studies on MBCT in chronic (27.8%; Michalak, Schultze, Heidenreich, & Schramm, 2015) or pharmacoresistant depressed patients (22.98%; Eisendrath et\u00a0al., 2016), but seems to be higher than in studies focusing on patients with recurrent depression (8.8%; van Aalderen et\u00a0al., 2011). Compared to completers, non\u2010completers reported a shorter duration of the current depressive episode and were more often unemployed. This could indicate that a longer duration might increase psychological burden and thereby motivates patients to acquire new skills. Additionally, a daily routine could be helpful in incorporating mindfulness skills into daily life. However, the sample of non\u2010completers is too small to draw firm conclusions here. Although one might expect that the most severely depressed patients drop out of treatment, non\u2010completers and completers did not differ in the severity of depressive symptoms, number of previous episodes, or age of onset. By contrast, a noticeable number of non\u2010completers reported that physical problems (see Figure\u00a01) interfered with participation and were the reason for discontinuing MBCT."], ["MBCT + TAU had significant effects on rumination, quality of life, mindfulness skills, and self\u2010compassion. Following the course, MBCT + TAU participants reported less rumination and a higher quality of life. The increase in mindfulness skills and self\u2010compassion might indicate that chronic, treatment\u2010resistant depressed patients are able to learn mindfulness meditation techniques and develop a more compassionate and friendlier attitude toward themselves. Although results of these secondary outcomes should be interpreted as preliminary, as the power analysis was focused on changes in depressive symptoms, this may indicate that MBCT + TAU has effects that could be valuable for chronic, treatment\u2010resistant depressed patients, even if no or only small changes in depressive symptoms are evoked."], ["This study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of MBCT + TAU for chronic, treatment\u2010resistant depressed patients who did not benefit from pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment. The current study has high ecological validity because of its pragmatic design. Participants were moderately to severely depressed outpatients and were enrolled in MBCT trainings provided regularly at their local mental health care institution. Thereby this study provides much\u2010needed insight into the effectiveness rather than efficacy of MBCT, which was formulated as an important research goal in a recent review paper of MBCT (Dimidjian & Segal, 2015). However, the effect sizes found in this study (ITT: d\u00a0=\u00a00.35; PP: d\u00a0=\u00a00.45) are smaller than in previous preliminary studies of chronic or treatment\u2010resistant depressed patients (Barnhofer et\u00a0al., 2009; Eisendrath et\u00a0al., 2008; Kenny & Williams, 2007), as well as smaller than the effect size found in previous research on currently depressed patients (d\u00a0=\u00a00.53; van Aalderen et\u00a0al., 2011), which was used for our power analysis. Both the relatively small effect size and the high drop\u2010out rate from MBCT can likely be explained by the higher severity of symptoms in the current study sample compared to previous research (van Aalderen et\u00a0al., 2011). As only completers showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms, obstacles to completing treatment should be investigated in future research, for example, by conducting qualitative interviews."], ["In addition to the effectiveness of MBCT, we also investigated possible moderators of treatment effect. Importantly, levels of rumination moderated the effect of MBCT + TAU compared to TAU on depressive symptoms. Participants with high levels of rumination benefitted more from MBCT + TAU than TAU. According to the underlying theoretical model, rumination is an important working mechanism of MBCT (Segal et\u00a0al., 2002) and previous work has indicated that rumination might mediate the effect of MBCT on depressive symptoms (Shahar, Britton, Sbarra, Figueredo, & Bootzin, 2010; van der Velden et\u00a0al., 2015). The current study indicates that MBCT could be particularly helpful for chronic, treatment\u2010resistant depressed patients with high levels of rumination. However, because of the explorative nature of the moderation analysis, this finding should be interpreted as preliminary and requires replication and further investigation. In addition, the results of the current study showed no moderating effects of childhood trauma, baseline severity of depression, chronicity, or treatment resistance. Moderating effects of childhood trauma and severity of baseline symptoms were previously found in recurrent depressed patients (Ma & Teasdale, 2004; Williams et\u00a0al., 2014). However, recent studies on MBCT in chronic or pharmacoresistant depression found no moderating effect of these variables (Eisendrath et\u00a0al., 2016; Michalak et\u00a0al., 2016), which is in line with our findings. Taken together, these results indicate that rumination might be an important moderator in chronic, treatment\u2010resistant depression, while levels of childhood trauma and severity of depressive symptoms at baseline appear to be of less influence."], ["A limitation of the current study is that MBCT was implemented as an add\u2010on to TAU. The results in the MBCT + TAU condition could therefore be partially due to nonspecific therapy effects, such as peer support, hope, and attention received from the therapist. Additionally, patients and investigators were not blind to treatment allocation, which might have been a potential source of bias. Future studies should compare MBCT to active treatments matched on treatment intensity and should also investigate long\u2010term effects and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, due to the pragmatic design of the study, MBCT trainings were not in all cases immediately available after randomization. Participants who had to wait more than 4\u00a0weeks until the start of MBCT received a second baseline assessment. This means that the total duration of the study is not identical for the conditions. However, one should note that we found no difference in depressive symptoms between the first and second baseline assessment. In addition, research designs investigating potential mediators such as rumination, mindfulness skills, and self\u2010compassion by including multiple assessments during the course of MBCT would give further insight into mechanisms of change."], ["The current study provides several clinical and research implications. Even though effects on depressive symptoms were not significant in the ITT analysis, results of the secondary outcome measures indicated that MBCT might have beneficial effects for chronic, treatment\u2010resistant patients on important factors other than depressive symptoms. In addition, the results of the PP analyses indicated that completers of MBCT + TAU did show a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms compared to TAU alone. Keeping in mind that the study sample represents a seriously ill population, small effects on depressive symptoms accompanied by effects on rumination, quality of life, mindfulness, and self\u2010compassion may be valuable for an individual patient. In addition, the relatively low costs and rare side effects of MBCT compared with other treatment options for this population, for example, intensive pharmacological treatment or electroconvulsive therapy, should be taken into account in treatment choice. However, it seems to be important to further investigate reasons why patients do not complete MBCT. Additionally, future research should further focus on rumination and other possible working mechanisms in order to provide researchers and clinicians with more information about the working mechanisms of MBCT and predictors of treatment success."]]}, "COMP_INT": {"CONFLICT OF INTEREST": [["A.E.M.
